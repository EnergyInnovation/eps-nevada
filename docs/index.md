## Documentation

Documentation of source data, assumptions, and policy scenarios is available [here](https://github.com/Energy-Innovation/eps-nevada/raw/main/Nevada%20EPS%20Scenario%20Assumptions.pdf). Documentation of the model is available [here](https://us.energypolicy.solutions/docs/index.html).  Documentation of the model is not specific to any model version and therefore applies to both U.S. and Nevada versions of the Energy Policy Simulator.
